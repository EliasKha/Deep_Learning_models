# Deep Learning Models

Differents basic deep learning models are added in this repository. The goal is to have a working basis in order work on more complex tasks.

Current Models:
- Iris_detection: Model performing a classification task to recognise an iris.
- Root_cause_prediction: Model able to find the root cause of a problem.
- Spam_detection: Model able to predict wether an sms is or not a spam.
